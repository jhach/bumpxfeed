Hola!

My name is Jalen Wu and I was a former pro wrestler in Southern California from 2009-2011. I performed and trained with AWS (Alternative Wrestling Show), NWPW (New Wave Pro Wrestling) where I was a tag team champion, IWL (Insane Wrestling League), and multiple indy lucha promotions around Los Angeles.

I created this project to help others succeed as a pro wrestler / sports entertainer. I'm data-driven and guarantee you'll consume a lot of stats to help grow and maximize your career.
